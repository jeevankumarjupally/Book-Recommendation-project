# 📚 Book Recommendation System

### 🔍 Smart Suggestions to Enhance Your Reading Journey

This project is a **content-based recommendation system** that suggests books to users based on their interests, reading patterns, and book metadata. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques like **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to find books similar to a given input.
